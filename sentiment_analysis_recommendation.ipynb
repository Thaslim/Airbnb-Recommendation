She also let me have a late check out at no extra cost, which was very kind of her. 5 stars for that! On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud. Once the heating problem is sorted out and the construction is done it will be a nice place to stay.',\n",

You can hear some noise in the street (I expected this because you are literally in the heart of the city) but I slept like the proverbial baby every night.

       " 'First of all I have to say, that Jennifer is not allowed to sublet her apartment by her landlord. I was instructed by her to not mention airbnb to anybody beforehand, which was fine, but one evening I was stopped by her landlord in the hallway and questioned about where I am staying, how long, where Jennifer is etc. Afterwards, although I didn’t say anything wrong, Jennifer freaked out about it, and I really thought for a few hours that I would have to move out and find another place to stay right away.

Manhattan is about a 40 minute subway ride so plan for that if you do decide to stay here.',\n",

Lisa è sempre stata disponibile a darci informazioni e verso le nostre esigenze. L alloggio è funzionale e pulito. Si accede attraverso una scala un Po stretta,(se si hanno problemi di mobilita potrebbe essere un problema) ma noi non abbiamo avuto problemi. Il  bagno è nuovo appena ristrutturato. La cucina è funzionante con l occorrente per preparare un semplice pasto. I letti sono comodi e le stanze abbastanza grandi dove mettere le valigie e i vestiti. Lenzuola e asciugamani puliti e in ottimo stato.Per correttezza di recensione senza nulla togliere l'alloggio, nelle foto sembra migliore con rifiniture più accurate, ma ripeto pulito e funzionale. L aria condizionata funziona a dovere e il WI FI  funzionale benissimo. Il quartiere sembra un Po trascurato, ma sembra sicuro,noi siamo rientrati anche a tarda sera senza mai avere sensazioni di pericolo o insicurezza. Nelle vicinanze sulla Franklin vi sono supermercati, negli isolati adiacenti vi sono piccoli negoziati aperti fino a tardi. La metropolitana si trova a 10 minuti. Nei dintorni vi sono diverse linee di bus. Ringraziamo Lisa per l ospitalità. Ci torneremo e lo consiglierei ad amici che vogliano visitare NY senza spendere una fortuna consapevoli di non essere in un hotel a 4 stelle. Consigliato \",\n",

The neighbourhood is great with lots of local food options - however it is on the flight path & the buses make it a bit noisy. We also hadn't realised that the trip in/out of Manhatten each day was fairly time consuming - in essence it gave us a great opportunity to see 'normal' life & we would never have gone to Brooklyn otherwise - which we really enjoyed - however as 'tourists' it was a trek in/out of the city\",\n",

       " \"We had a great stay at LisaRoxanne's place when we stayed for 3 nights in October. The apartment is relatively well located for the subway (less than 10 mins walk) and was equipped as shown in the pictures. Short walk to a few coffee shops/restaurants/bars. The living area had a good wifi connection, the bed was big and comfy and the bedroom was very spacious with A/C.  The only thing to bear in mind, as another reviewer has noted, is that even though the guest area occupies the whole of the top floor of the building there is no dividing wall or door for the area - other than the bedroom door.  This doesn't cause any major problems but it does mean that noise from the family living area below travels up the stairs more easily and has a feeling of the area not being completely private - although this was just a feeling as we had sole use of the top floor. LisaRoxanne was a friendly and responsive host before and during our stay.\",\n",

Her husband does Uber part time, so that is an extra convenience for you. \",\n",

The neighbourhood is nice and there is an area of lots of shops and resteraunts in walking distance which towards the end of our trip we preferred to Manhattan. To go into the city is really easy by Train. \",\n",

Man bekommt zwar geräuschmäsig schon etwas von der Familie mit, allerdings hat uns in unserem Privatbereich nie jemand gestört. Zudem war bei unserer Ankunft alles sehr sauber. Zur Metro sind es nur wenige Gehminuten & von dort aus ist man in ca. 25 Minuten direkt in Manhattan. Wer also einen günstigen Aufenthalt in New York verbringen möchte & bereit ist auch ein bisschen zu fahren, für den ist es die perfekte Unterkunft.:-)',\n",

       " \"LisaRoxanne is a lovely person. However her listing description is not accurate. The set up is odd as it is actually inside their home. It is not a private apt/space and therefore should not be advertised as such. There is one key to the building's main entrance downstairs and that is it. The space does not have a front door you can lock when you leave for the day. You can hear the host family clearly as they are right down a few step (interior staircase). \",\n",
       " \"Great place to stay on a budget! LisaRoxanne was friendly and accommodating. Plenty of beds and overnight materials for up to 5 guests, but know it's one bedroom and one kitchen/bathroom area on the top floor of their home, so it's not exactly the most private place to stay, but we were absolutely given our space and could easily come and go as we wished.\",\n",

There are some thin curtains that work for privacy and do block some night street light, but not all. The apartment was clean and had all the amenities we needed. It was very quiet and we didn't see anyone except when we checked in. Private enough for us. We heard people occasionally - the family has some kids - but it was just normal living noises. The check-in was flexible. The location is good in terms of being accessible to Brooklyn and Manhatten. It was easy to get anywhere by car (or transit). We were able to get to Prospect Park very easily and it is close to transit lines, although we didn't use transit as we had our dog. The neighbourhood was pretty quiet and felt safe. Close to Clinton Hill. Great to be dog friendly for us! Would stay again. \",\n",

All this is located at the top of this family Brooklyn brownstone, which does mean using the same front door and staircase as the family but hey this is what airB'nB is all about isn't it? Once you're upstairs you are very much in your own space and self-containned, and the house is mercifully ( we went in late Feb/early March) very warm, and has constant hot water too.\",\n",

It was lovely to come back to this quiet neighborhood after a day of bustle in the city. There are several sweet markets, cafes, and restaurants within walking distance as well. It was nice to have the whole third floor with a full kitchen so you can cook if you like. This was especially handy for breakfast and coffee.  You can hear their sweet kids playing downstairs.

We would recommend anyone to stay there.  Great kitchen, bathroom is good and the bed extra comfy.  Being on the top floor we didn't hear a lot of passing traffic. Highly recommend this Airbnb.

The only thing that really was a concern for us was the smell of cats. My husband and I are both sensitive to cats and it finally caught up with us the last evening/morning of staying. The room was perfect for what we needed because we spent most of our time in the city. Only thing I wished the room had was a full length mirror so I could see my outfits better for our evenings. I would definitely recommend staying at Lisa's for any type of trip. She was a great host and evening got us a bottle of wine for our anniversary. Thanks Lisa\",\n",

If you're limited on luggage space you could walk in here with nothing but clothes - LisaRoxanne has thought of everything from toothbrushes to UK adaptors! The space is great and transport into Manhattan easy.  You can have privacy if you want it but they are such a nice family I can't think why you wouldn't want to interact. Her little boy Isiah (sorry if I got that wrong) is a real darling.  Can't recommend highly enough. \",\n",

The bedroom door does have a lock on the knob. Gave 3 stars just because of the noise we experienced. We were awakened at 2am when the family came home, then again around 6:30am when the kids were playing in their play area and getting ready for school.

The location is fabulous - close to subway stops and a short walk away from all the excellent bars and food in the area (go to Vanessa's on Eldridge St. for delicious cheap dumplings/sesame pancakes/soup). It is also close to other great neighbourhoods. Yasmine reserved a space in the fridge for us and had also labelled the apartment keys - which seems like a small thing but actually makes life easier, no fumbling at the door. Yasmine is also out a lot - she's a very busy lady! - so you do have the apartment to yourself quite a lot if that's your thing. The AC and the street below the room (which has lots of nice windows) is pretty noisy - but you really can't expect much else in NY and we slept well with earplugs.

The street noise is really no big deal considering the very, very convenient 2nd floor location.  The noise is typical for New York.  Bring ear plugs and a sleeping pill if you really want to be assured a good night's sleep.  (Shun and Akiko, here is my one important suggestion:  Go to IKEA or Bed, Bath & Beyond (or even JCPenney) and get a set of matching sheets, duvet / comforter cover and 2-4 matching pillows and pillowcases.  The sheets,  and especially the pillows,  were sub-standard even at your very competitive rate.  If you do this, you would definitely earn 5-stars from me!

He seemed to understand from the moment I got there what I wanted and needed.  The room is clean and comfortable.  The down comforter and flat screen were more than I ever expected.  The tea and cocoa were perfect for the times I came in for a rest from my long walks on the sidewalks of my favorite city. The apartment is just three blocks from Columbus Circle,  and just a few blocks to the Theatre District.  There are good places to eat very near by. The bakery around the corner on Eighth Ave was very good and Luigi’s Pizza across the avenue was a favorite of my teenage son’s last time we were there as a family.  I was able to live like a New Yorker for those three days and it was exactly what I needed.  I will definitely stay with Shun and Akiko again when I come to NYC. I recommend this accommodation to anyone who wants to experience living in NYC, not just visiting.  I know this neighborhood well, having lived there in the 80’s, and I could not have asked for more. It was like being home, only a lot better, because I was unfettered and able to do exactly what I wanted.  I can’t wait to go back again. Thank you, Shun!  ',\n",

It was our first visit to New York and it would have been appreciated if Shun had at least on one occasion (perhaps upon arrival or the day after) offered some information about the area or check with us if we had any questions. We thought Shun was friendly but very reserved .Bottom line: great location, close to places of interest (we practically walked everywhere), clean but basic accommodation, however, don't expect a social, interactive host because once you've checked-in, you're on your own!

There is couple of restaurants around the corner and pharmacy for all your immediate needs.  Shun was very flexible accomodating me as I was later than expected due to travel complications.  He waited at the apartment to receive me.  He even grabbed my bags up to the second floor. The main entrance is a small hallway that leads to the two rooms. If you a tad bit alergic to dust , you should not stay here.  Otherwise, the room is very large, with a small working fridge, microwave and lots of channels for cable.  This kitchen is a bit odd to use since it is in the host's living area and you would be separated by a glass door.  If you are there for a short stay then eating out and buying things that can be reheated would work best.  Although, Shun said that if I needed a cup or plate from the kitchen I was free to use which was nice of him.  The hosts were very quiet all weekend I really didn't see them.  Although, if I needed something I'm sure I could have asked.  I would say location-wise and room needs this was a decent place.\",\n",

Perfect location to get around to all the sights and around restaurants/eateries not in the high tourist area. Had a great meal/marguerita at Cancun, just around the corner. The room is as described, handy to have your own fridge/kettle in the room, and great to spread out on the table/chair/shelves/wardrobe so you're not living out of your bag the whole time. Would recommend to others looking for budget accommodation without sacrificing too much.\",\n",

One irony is that, after an initial meeting with Shun during which he gave me a friendly orientation to the room and the apartment, I only caught brief glimpses of him for the next 9 days.  He was off to work by 8:00 a.m. and came home usually late so I had almost no contact with him!

Anyway, first appearances of the building might be scary for some. It is rather run down. Indeed, the apartment must not have enough storage space because there are boxes lining the hallway leading to the main part of the apartment. The room is very basic, but is as advertised.

The apartment is located a couple of blocks south of central park and the subway station and a few blocks north of times square which made for great travelling times to all parts of the city. The apartment itself was nothing special. All the amenities were as described in the website except for an air conditioner, which i obviously did not need as i was visiting in winter. The room looked a bit worn down and probably needed a paint job. Some people here commented that the toilet was dirty but that was not the case. The apartment and toilet was a bit worn down but by no means dirty. Keep in mind that you are renting an apartment and not a luxury hotel. It is certainly good value for money and a great place to stay for a couple of days. Last but not the least, the host was very polite and friendly and i didn't get to see him much except while checking in and checking out. So, my honest assessment and recommendation is this- If you are looking for luxury and great comfort, then go to a luxury hotel. But if you want value for money, great location and a new yorker feeling stay at shunichi's, you'll not regret it!!\",\n",

Shunichi met me at check in & showed my the unit & all important things. We didn't see each other much at all for my whole 8-day stay. I will book with Shunichi again / every visit to NYC.

Praticamente potevo beccare qualche malattia.Comunque non voglio allungarmi scrivendo quello che ho trascorso in 5 notti in quella orrenda casa , vi dico solo di stare lontano da questa casa e non accettate nemmeno se il prezzo e' bassissimo perche' la vostra vacanza sara' rovinata!!! Mi dispiace che non posso mettere le foto di quella casa ORRIBILE senno' non c'era bisogno nemmeno di scrivere , attenzione che io ho scritto questo ma in realta' e' molto peggio e dico cosi' perche' non ci potete credere se non vivendo l'esperienza che ho fatto io!!   colgo l'occasione per ringraziare i membri di airbnb che sono stati eccezionali! Prima esperienza (Website hidden by Airbnb) che posso contare su questo staff!GRAZIE\",\n",
       " 'Although the room was comfortable, and although Shunichi was a nice guy, no one was there when we got the apartment. We had to wait for over half an hour around the corner in a local restaurant....this is not something we wanted to after many hours of flying. It also seemed this happened to the couple staying after us but for a considerably longer time. Aside from that nothing bad to say. The location was ideal so if you do not mind waiting  then this is the place for you.',\n",

Before we left he agreed for us to leave the same luggage in his living room so we could explore more of the city. We loved the experience and stay there again any time',\n",
       " \"Shunichi's place was perfect for exploring New York. We didn't see him much as he was working and we were so busy, but whenever we did meet he was kind and helpful. The place is about ten minutes walk to times square and this makes it so much easier, rarely having to get the subway anywhere. Great place to stay in New York for a couple of days.\",\n",
       " \"The room is quite big and comfortable. The only problem is that it was summer and the air conditioning wasn't really working so it was very hot and the tv didn't work. Other than that there was no problem. He was very nice about check in and out times, because I had a flight to catch after the checkout time and he let me keep the bags in the apartment so that was cool. The stay in Shunichi's place was good overall.\",\n",

       " \"Our apartment building in Philadelphia caught fire, and much of our possessions were ruined and the whole building rendered uninhabitable by water damage the day before I had planned to stay with Shunichi.  So I feel asleep within an hour after arriving at his apartment and didn't wake up until the next morning.  Which goes to show that the room faces a quiet street and that the bed is comfortable, even if a metal frame.  The room is as it looks in the photo, with the additions of a table cloth, cups, mugs and a small mirror, without the plant, stool and dark full length curtain, now replaced by a shorter one that lets the light through it.  Shunichi was very communicative about my move in and had no problem with me coming earlier than I initially indicated,nor with me leaving my luggage at his place until I left the city the following day.  Then I crashed out.  \",\n",

La casa e in una posizione centralissima, vicino a central park e Times square e alle fermate della metro, per cui ci è stato facile muovevi con comodità. È una casa che vale quello che paghi, cioè poco, ricorda molto la trasmissione televisiva \"\"sepolti in casa\"\"! È ideale se usata esclusivamente per pochi giorni e per passarci la notte.

The shelves were grimy, we had to wipe them down ourselves. There was also lots of hair strands on the duvet, but thankfully no bugs. There is also no lift, so if you have large luggage, it's quite a hassle up the stairs.\",\n",

Es befindet sich in einem stark renovierungsbedürftigen Zustand. Flecken an der Decke, dreckige Wände und auch auch der Bereich, wo der Kühlschrank und die Mikrowelle stehen, ist sehr keimig.

Enjoyed my stay a lot and would definitely stay again :)',\n",
       " \"My stay at this apartment was not the best experience, but if what you care about the most is a great location, then this is the place for you. The picture is a good reference of what to expect, although simply add an unpleasant layer of grime to everything and you have a more accurate idea. My main issue was that the room, while tidy, felt unclean and the bathroom was unpleasantly dirty, to say the least. The apartment looks really worn and it is right next to the trash room, so opening the door you smell the trash and it can be pretty disgusting. However, the inside of the apartment smelled fine. I appreciated that the room is independent of the owner's space, as a door separates the room and the bathroom from the living room and the owner's room. It was also very convenient that the room came with a fridge, microwave, toaster, and even plates and cutlery. It is pleasantly large and the bed was more of a full-sized futon. The a/c worked, but not very well, which is not an inconvenience unless one comes in the summertime like I did. Our host provided us with a room key, so it was nice to be able to lock the room and feel my stuff would not be disturbed. I didn't really see much of the owner, as a friend of his welcomed me when I arrived, and I believe that if I hadn't proceeded to ask him a few questions the one day I saw him at the apartment, we might never have talked, as he always left before I did and arrived apparently after. However, the main thing about this apartment is the location. Incredible location! It is walking distance from  Columbus Circle and all the theater area and Times Square, which made it very convenient when I got out of a play late at night. There are also a number of grocery stores nearby, including an organic whole foods style one. There are nearby subway stations and tons of restaurants, so it is easy to find anything one might need within a few blocks.\",\n",

That person was still in the room, sheets all messy, dirty towels on the bed...nasty view. The host was already on his way to receive us due to the fact that his friend never showed up. He apologized and was quick to \"\"prepare the room\"\". Honestly',\n",

       " \"My whole experience at Shunichi's place was perfect! Check in was easy. I just let him know about what time I was expected to arrive and he arranged a friend to let me in and provide me the keys. You can't beat the location. It's only a few blocks away from the Columbus Circle subway station, which is right next to Central Park. One block south is an NYPD station, so the neighborhood is fairly safe. Around the corner is Mariella's Pizza, which I highly recommend. There are several 24 hour stores in the area for your convenience. The room is very spacious and is perfect for one person, but it can accommodate two people comfortably. The mini fridge was very useful and the air conditioner worked adequately, especially during summer.  The bathroom was clean and functional and towels were provided. I stayed here for a whole week and actually saw Shunichi only one time and waved hello, so I had my privacy the entire time of my stay. I really enjoyed my stay here.

       " \"Mon amie et moi-même avons profité de l'appartement de Suchini durant 15 jours (du 26/12/16 au 08/01/17). J'ai beaucoup hésité pour la note entre 3 et 4 mais finalement j'ai tranché sur un 3 et je m'explique tout de suite. Tout d'abord parlons des points positifs : - l'appartement a une situation idéale, à 5 min de Central Park, à 10 minutes de Time Square. Le top ! On était à proximité de tout : de boutiques souvenirs, de restaurants, de fast-foods, de Columbus Circle où on peut faire ses courses facilement, bref parfait ! - la chambre est vraiment spacieuse (avec mon amie on s'est vraiment étalé, et oui on est des filles :p, mais on était vraiment à l’aise) et des équipements à dispo un frigo, un micro-onde, de la vaisselle, une TV (un peu sensible avec l'antenne), un Wi-Fi un peu capricieux parfois avec notre ordinateur, quelques nécessaires de toilette, des plans de NY à dispo... - la cuisine est à dispo et à tout ce qu'il faut pour se cuisiner des repas rapides (cela change des fast-foods à gogo :)) - la salle de bain est spacieuse également. Pas de petite salle de bain toute riquiqui, non il y a de la place dans la douche, pour se préparer, pour utiliser le lavabo… Mais malheureusement il y a quand même quelques points négatifs à retenir et pas des moindres comme : - la propreté en général. Nous ne sommes pas regardantes avec mon amie sur 2-3 poils qui pourraient se trouver dans une douche ou un grain de poussière dans l'appartement. Mais là c'était vraiment très limite, sans parler de la vétusté de l'appart, la salle de bain était vraiment borderline avec des poils, des cheveux, de la poussière par terre, le lavabo n'était pas nettoyé, je doute que le tapis soit lavé par exemple aussi. Et dans la cuisine, la plaque de gaz était grasse, noire de saleté... Dans la chambre, on aurait apprécié des draps propres entre ces deux semaines, le sol n’était pas vraiment propre, et le frigo n’était pas nettoyé. Bref nous étions vraiment déçues par rapport à cela. Et je reprécise que pourtant nous ne sommes pas difficiles en règle générale. - la salle de bain. En plus d'être très vieille (des barres de douche rouillées, des murs moisis, une vieille plomberie), prendre une douche était vraiment un calvaire. Une fois brûlante et une fois glacée, on arrivait à régler l'eau une fois sur 10. Et autant dire que c'est frustrant de pas pouvoir prendre une douche correcte quand on a marché toute la journée et qu'on est crevé. Enfin dernier point, plutôt mitigé - la communication avec l’hôte. Alors certes l’hôte est très discret et pour des gens comme moi qui préfère cela aux personnes envahissantes, c’était parfait. Néanmoins mon amie a regretté le fait de ne pas avoir parfois des infos, des recommandations (nous nous ne sommes même pas souhaités la bonne année, c’est quand même dommage quand deux...\",\n",

The bed was really comfortable. We didn't meet the  host but his communication was always really quick.There was a bit of noise at night but it is the middle of Manhattan so you have to expect that.

It fit my needs perfectly, as I was doing very touristy things and only was in the apartment at night. Shunuchi was very accommodating. My flight was delayed and I arrived to check in 3 hours after I had planned to and he was still very kind!

Shunichi provided a comfortable room with a tv, DVD player(remote needs batteries), Small fridge, microwave oven, and other appliances such as a toaster, etc. There is also a closet and a shelf-system that is perfect for your clothes. Shunichi was very prompt in replying to texts when I got to town and near his residence. He helped me carry my luggage up the 1 flight of stairs and when I made an inquiry about salt, he was at my door within 2 minutes. And that was all I saw of my host the entire week. It was like I was all alone the entire week. Since I am not a Social Butterfly around strangers, it was perfect for me. Price was VERY reasonable for staying in NYC. Thank you.\",\n",

Shunichi gives you lots of privacy and the apartment is tidy and full of great touches. The listing is very straightforward, but I would argue that it’s better than the description!

Street noise broke sleep first night, despite fan -- then I adjusted but, as noted, it's present.  Bed was fine and large room with closet and desk makes for a good situation.  Bathroom is the only other room you have access to, but kettle and small fridge in bedroom makes it workable.  As noted, this is basic -- think dorm-room style -- then remind yourself again about the location; neighborhood felt safe even at night.  2nd floor with lots of stairs but also high ceiling in room of this old building. Host was prompt on communication and exceptionally quiet. \",\n",

Would definitely recommend and stay there again.\",\n",

The room is okay and the bathroom is not the best but it works if you don't expect much and are there just to sleep at night and take a shower. The host was barely visible so you don't have to worry about him being in the way. We didn't get to use the kitchen but we never asked either so we don't know if it wasn't allowed at all. Overall, the location is great. There are a couple of subways, restaurants and markets to buy breakfast nearby. Not far from Times Square and Broadway. Shunichi was great at answering all questions we had so I really recommend to stay at his place while in New York.\",\n",

Además de la ubicación, tienes absoluta privacidad, a veces no sabes si Shunichi está en casa, entras y sales sin problema. La cama esta muy bien y las sabanas estaban limpias. La ducha no estaba limpísima pero las he visto mucho peores, es aceptable ducharse ahí si piensas en lo barato del alojamiento y el sitio en el q está. Si vas a New York para estar todo el dia en la calle, y pasar el tiempo justo en el alojamiento para dormir descansar y ducharte es una opcion barata que te gustará. Yo repetiría! No es apto para príncipes y princesas pero estás en pleno Manhattan por muy poco dinero. Shunichi es agradable y muy escueto, tuvimos un problema con una llave y lo solucionó rapidamente. Todo fue correcto.',\n",

The bathroom had some stains, grime and mold. There were old curtains but it got the job done. The bedroom was dusty and dark but the bed was a good size and the host/host's friend provided us more blankets and pillows if needed. Overall, for the price and location, it's definitely a steal.

Nos dio facilidades para dejar la maleta en el pasillo el último día hasta que cogimos el avión. Lo más importante del apartamento es que está muy bien situado (entre Central Park y Times Square). Si no eres muy escrupuloso por lo del baño (y te llevas unas chanclas), en general está bien para lo que pagas. Si eres muy fino, busca otro.',\n",

(shun and akiko, here is my one important suggestion:  go to ikea or bed, bath & beyond (or even jcpenney) and get a set of matching sheets, duvet / comforter cover and 2-4 matching pillows and pillowcases.  the sheets,  and especially the pillows,  were sub-standard even at your very competitive rate.  if you do this, you would definitely earn 5-stars from me!  thanks again for a fantastic stay overall!  you guys were wonderful!!\",\n",
