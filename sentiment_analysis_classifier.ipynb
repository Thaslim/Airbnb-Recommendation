Jennifer, the host sent in a cleaning lady right the next morning and therefore did everything she thought was appropriate to make our stay comfortable. She let us know that guest satisfaction is important to her.   \\r\\nAfter we found out that the key for the main entrance was missing by locking ourselves out in the middle of the night she was so kind to bring us the missing key within an hour. \\r\\nWe had to leave the apartment a few days earlier because we suffered from an allergic reaction (which has never happened before and never after) related to the air conditioner as our doctor told us. \\r\\nThe apartment is located in a great area! Subway stations are just two minutes away! The area seems quite safe although there are “special” adult video stores located in the same street nearby.  \\r\\nA deli/grocery store is next to the building, a 24 hours open pharmacy is across the end of the street! \\r\\n',\n",

Any more may feel a little cramped.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, most Airnb places I stay feel liked they have been furnished by a recent college grad. It's clear that Jennifer lives here and was so accomodating opening up her home to us.\",\n",

She also let me have a late check out at no extra cost, which was very kind of her. 5 stars for that! On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud. Once the heating problem is sorted out and the construction is done it will be a nice place to stay.',\n",

I was instructed by her to not mention airbnb to anybody beforehand, which was fine, but one evening I was stopped by her landlord in the hallway and questioned about where I am staying, how long, where Jennifer is etc. Afterwards, although I didn’t say anything wrong, Jennifer freaked out about it, and I really thought for a few hours that I would have to move out and find another place to stay right away. From that point on I felt really unsafe there and always tried to hide from the landlord. \\n\\nFor my stay the apartment was also not ideal, there is no couch, only cushions on the floor and there is no real table and chairs. I had to work from home sometimes and could not really do it anywhere. \\nThe place was really clean in general, only the bathroom and the shower were really not okay. Especially the shower curtain was mildewed. \\nThe kitchen was clean and well equipped. \\nApartment has an AC, which is definitely a pro. \\n\\nAlso, what should be mentioned , the hallway is really narrow and the stairs are quite steep, so with a huge suitcase not ideal, as the apartment is walk-up to the 4th floor.\\n\\nThe location of the apartment is alright, in my opinion it is a bit busy in that area and there are nicer places to live, bit that is just my personal opinion.',\n",

You're also close to the C and G trains, so transportation is easy. \\r\\nThe space is clean and neat, if spare. It really is much more of a one-floor apartment than a private room, as you will only have interactions with the family on the shared stairs and stoop.

L aria condizionata funziona a dovere e il WI FI  funzionale benissimo. Il quartiere sembra un Po trascurato, ma sembra sicuro,noi siamo rientrati anche a tarda sera senza mai avere sensazioni di pericolo o insicurezza. Nelle vicinanze sulla Franklin vi sono supermercati, negli isolati adiacenti vi sono piccoli negoziati aperti fino a tardi. La metropolitana si trova a 10 minuti.

We also hadn't realised that the trip in/out of Manhatten each day was fairly time consuming - in essence it gave us a great opportunity to see 'normal' life & we would never have gone to Brooklyn otherwise - which we really enjoyed - however as 'tourists' it was a trek in/out of the city\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accommodation was perfectly adequate for what we needed - good amenities - lisaRoxanne even thought to leave us a couple of umbrellas which was well appreciated - eating in would have been really easy but with NYC on the doorstep, why would you? \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks & goodluck LisaRoxanne \",\n",

The living area had a good wifi connection, the bed was big and comfy and the bedroom was very spacious with A/C.  The only thing to bear in mind, as another reviewer has noted, is that even though the guest area occupies the whole of the top floor of the building there is no dividing wall or door for the area - other than the bedroom door.  This doesn't cause any major problems but it does mean that noise from the family living area below travels up the stairs more easily and has a feeling of the area not being completely private - although this was just a feeling as we had sole use of the top floor.

Plenty of beds and overnight materials for up to 5 guests, but know it's one bedroom and one kitchen/bathroom area on the top floor of their home, so it's not exactly the most private place to stay, but we were absolutely given our space and could easily come and go as we wished.\",\n",

The apartment was spotless and we had our own little kitchen to make breakfast on a morning. LisaRoxanne was friendly and had helpfully printed us lots of useful travel instructions and local eateries. And it was easily the cheapest room available for miles! Thanks very much ',\n",
       " \"Perfect spot for us this long weekend. We didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment, but when we were there it was just fine! The bed is comfortable and all the linens were clean. There are some thin curtains that work for privacy and do block some night street light, but not all. The apartment was clean and had all the amenities we needed. It was very quiet and we didn't see anyone except when we checked in. Private enough for us. We heard people occasionally - the family has some kids - but it was just normal living noises. The check-in was flexible. The location is good in terms of being accessible to Brooklyn and Manhatten. It was easy to get anywhere by car (or transit). We were able to get to Prospect Park very easily and it is close to transit lines, although we didn't use transit as we had our dog. The neighbourhood was pretty quiet and felt safe. Close to Clinton Hill. Great to be dog friendly for us! Would stay again. \",\n",

All this is located at the top of this family Brooklyn brownstone, which does mean using the same front door and staircase as the family but hey this is what airB'nB is all about isn't it? Once you're upstairs you are very much in your own space and self-containned, and the house is mercifully ( we went in late Feb/early March) very warm, and has constant hot water too.\\nThis served us very well as a base for exploring Brooklyn and Manhattan in particular as the brownstone is close to 4 subway stations the nearest two being around 6-8 mins walk and the other two, 10 and 15 mins respectively.\\nLike most people we tended to go out after an early breakfast and spend the whole day and evening out coming back late to this rather quiet suburban area for a welcome relax and sleep.\\nAll in all: excellent value, great location, terrific hostess well equipped accommodationwith everything you're likely to need for a great holiday in NYC: we stayed for a week and loved every minute!\",\n",

It was nice to have the whole third floor with a full kitchen so you can cook if you like. This was especially handy for breakfast and coffee.  You can hear their sweet kids playing downstairs. It's not intrusive--they really respected our privacy-and it's just normal happy family noise. It was a wonderful stay all around!  Thank you LisaRoxanne!!\",\n",

The only thing that really was a concern for us was the smell of cats. My husband and I are both sensitive to cats and it finally caught up with us the last evening/morning of staying. The room was perfect for what we needed because we spent most of our time in the city. Only thing I wished the room had was a full length mirror so I could see my outfits better for our evenings. I would definitely recommend staying at Lisa's for any type of trip. She was a great host and evening got us a bottle of wine for our anniversary. Thanks Lisa\",\n",

The space is great and transport into Manhattan easy.  You can have privacy if you want it but they are such a nice family I can't think why you wouldn't want to interact.

She also helped with maps of NY as well as advice about transport back to the airport for us which came in handy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, a good place to stay in place of location and accessibility.  Thanks Tina, for your help.\",\n",

The neighbourhood is good as well, you have some restaurantes nearby like subway, mcdonalds, sushi etc. There is also a mini market next door  where you can buy food and drink and the supermarket is 2 blocks away.\\r\\nTina gave us a NYC guide and it was really useful, she left many brochures from restaurants also to order food at home.\\r\\nThe cats aren't bad but they aren't clean at all, we found poop on the kitchen table once and we had to clean vomit like 4 times because one of them seemed to be sick. Because of this we didn't like to cook or even to eat at home and we didn't use the sofa because we found vomit there also.\\r\\nThe windows have no blinds or dark curtains, so the neighbours can see you at any time in the bedroom and the kitchen.\\r\\nIt is a 5th floor without elevator, it wasn't a problem for us but you should be aware of it.\\r\\nI do recommend Tina's place if you are looking for a well located place to sleep, but not to spend much time there.\",\n",

Don't expect a quiet stay though because the Manhattan symphony of sirens, car horns and engine noise comes full blast through the windows 24/7.

Loved AppleTV, you can definitely hear the traffic noise so light sleepers need earplugs. I noticed the shower head was really high so probably not ideal for petite/shorter people.

Ci aspettavamo che fosse un po' più nuovo e curato (il letto aveva le molle molto rovinate e, sopratutto i primi giorni, si sentiva abbastanza puzza di fumo e un odore strano in casa). Ho amato particolarmente la zona soggiorno, con il bel divano, la poltrona in pelle e la Apple Tv per rilassarsi.\\r\\nBuona posizione (meno di dieci minuti a piedi dalla Grand Central Station); ottimo poi il wifi gratis. In appartamento facevamo solo colazione ma, volendo, la cucina è abbastanza attrezzata per fare tranquillamente anche altri pasti.\\r\\nLa comunicazione con Tina è stata buona. A parte iniziali fraintendimenti, dopo esserci chiariti Tina è stata molto gentile e disponibile e, durante il nostro soggiorno, ci scriveva spesso per sapere se andava tutto bene.\\r\\nPiccole annotazioni: le scale sono molte e ripide (Tina lo scrive chiaramente e quindi lo sapevamo!), portatevi valigie poco pesanti e comode da trasportare!!; il riscaldamento centralizzato funziona fin troppo bene (e non si può spegnere), dovevamo dormire con le finestre del soggiorno leggermente aperte nonostante la stagione! Il traffico è quello tipico di New York..Consiglio quindi dei tappi per le orecchie per il rumore e delle mascherine per gli occhi per dormire (le finestre non hanno gli oscuranti).\\r\\nNel complesso siamo stati soddisfatti!! Vale la pena provare a vivere in un vero appartamento newyorkese e, sicuramente, si ha a disposizione molto più spazio che in hotel..\\r\\n\",\n",

The location is fabulous - close to subway stops and a short walk away from all the excellent bars and food in the area (go to Vanessa's on Eldridge St. for delicious cheap dumplings/sesame pancakes/soup). It is also close to other great neighbourhoods. Yasmine reserved a space in the fridge for us and had also labelled the apartment keys - which seems like a small thing but actually makes life easier, no fumbling at the door. Yasmine is also out a lot - she's a very busy lady! - so you do have the apartment to yourself quite a lot if that's your thing.

Easy walk to the Lower East side\\r\\nThe only awkward thing was that she locked her room as she had a bad experience with a guest.

Unfortunately, the air conditioning was under repair and there was a July heat wave, which made the evenings and mornings very hot in the apartment, but Yasmine did everything she could to ensure our comfort under the circumstances. \\r\\nI would recommend Yasmine's apartment to visitors to New York. Travelling on the subway and walking through the neighbourhood to get there is an excellent way to experience 'real' New York'. I would recommend using the 2nd Ave subway, the Whole Foods shop by that subway for both groceries and cooked meals, and to wander around that neighbourhood as there are loads of funky shops and cafes which I only discovered later in the week, along with neighbourhood sports fields and courts which the locals use for team sports.  It's got a nice atmosphere and feels safe to walk through. The alternative Grand St subway takes you through Chinatown to Jasmine's apartment, which provides a different experience again - the sights and smells a little like being in Asia. \\r\\nWe used the two day hop on hop off bus tours, which was an excellent way to see around Manhatten and the evening tour across Brooklyn Bridge and around Brooklyn provided stunning night views of New York city. Another highlight was to sit in Times Square during the evening and just watch the world go by.\\r\\nThank you Yasmine. It was great meeting you.\\r\\nLibby Gairdner, New Zealand\",\n",

We also have a lot in common in area of culture! I'll recommend this place to everyone who is open-minded and want to feel how people live there in NYC. Neighborhood looked safe. Despite it was one of the coldest weeks for last year in town, but heating worked well and the room was warm!\",\n",

These are true gentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bed was very comfortable and cozy. I slept very well.

He even offered to connect his extra laptop for me to have web access to look up theater times, museum info, etc.  The microwave, refrigerator, and flat panel TV (with cable) are all great amenities.  The street noise is really no big deal considering the very, very convenient 2nd floor location.  The noise is typical for New York.  Bring ear plugs and a sleeping pill if you really want to be assured a good night's sleep.  (Shun and Akiko, here is my one important suggestion:  Go to IKEA or Bed, Bath & Beyond (or even JCPenney) and get a set of matching sheets, duvet / comforter cover and 2-4 matching pillows and pillowcases.  The sheets,  and especially the pillows,  were sub-standard even at your very competitive rate.  If you do this, you would definitely earn 5-stars from me!  Thanks again for a fantastic stay overall!  You guys were wonderful!!\",\n",

He seemed to understand from the moment I got there what I wanted and needed.  The room is clean and comfortable.  The down comforter and flat screen were more than I ever expected.  The tea and cocoa were perfect for the times I came in for a rest from my long walks on the sidewalks of my favorite city. The apartment is just three blocks from Columbus Circle,  and just a few blocks to the Theatre District.  There are good places to eat very near by. The bakery around the corner on Eighth Ave was very good and Luigi’s Pizza across the avenue was a favorite of my teenage son’s last time we were there as a family.  I was able to live like a New Yorker for those three days and it was exactly what I needed.  I will definitely stay with Shun and Akiko again when I come to NYC. I recommend this accommodation to anyone who wants to experience living in NYC, not just visiting.  I know this neighborhood well, having lived there in the 80’s, and I could not have asked for more. It was like being home, only a lot better, because I was unfettered and able to do exactly what I wanted.  I can’t wait to go back again. Thank you, Shun!  ',\n",

We thought Shun was friendly but very reserved .Bottom line: great location, close to places of interest (we practically walked everywhere), clean but basic accommodation, however, don't expect a social, interactive host because once you've checked-in, you're on your own!

He waited at the apartment to receive me.  He even grabbed my bags up to the second floor. The main entrance is a small hallway that leads to the two rooms. If you a tad bit alergic to dust , you should not stay here.  Otherwise, the room is very large, with a small working fridge, microwave and lots of channels for cable.  This kitchen is a bit odd to use since it is in the host's living area and you would be separated by a glass door.  If you are there for a short stay then eating out and buying things that can be reheated would work best.  Although, Shun said that if I needed a cup or plate from the kitchen I was free to use which was nice of him.  The hosts were very quiet all weekend I really didn't see them.  Although, if I needed something I'm sure I could have asked.  I would say location-wise and room needs this was a decent place.\",\n",

The inside of the building is not the greatest and in an OK condition. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Host was really quite, friendly and very helpful. You have a tv with a good selection of channels, wired interenet, a table, a chair and a stool. The bed is comfy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed my stay there but I would probably stay in a hotel next time.

The room is as described, handy to have your own fridge/kettle in the room, and great to spread out on the table/chair/shelves/wardrobe so you're not living out of your bag the whole time.

The whole room was unbelievable dirty and seemed not beeing cleaned properly for ages. Hairs everywhere, crumbs on the floor and a lot of dust. Honestly it was a small shock when we entered the room for the first time. Before our trip to New York we read all of the ratings here and decided us for Shun, because nearly everyone stated how clean the apartement is. We are definitely not stuffy, but this is simply not true.  The same for the bathroom. Dozens of hairs everywhere (floor,  washbasin, shower) and a lot of mold on the shower curtain, the window and the  bath tub. Honestly it was a kind of disgusting.\\r\\nThis was our first trip with airbnb and it was probably our last too. We have no explanation how 140+ ratings can differ from our impression so much.

At first I thought his building was a little run-down, but the room itself had everything I needed - a small fridge, air-conditioning (it was hot!), a microwave, dishes, cutlery, a desk, storage space, and a comfortable bed.  The shower would be better with more water pressure, but this was a minor matter.  Shun himself was there waiting for me and helped with the luggage.

The apartment is located a couple of blocks south of central park and the subway station and a few blocks north of times square which made for great travelling times to all parts of the city. The apartment itself was nothing special. All the amenities were as described in the website except for an air conditioner, which i obviously did not need as i was visiting in winter. The room looked a bit worn down and probably needed a paint job. Some people here commented that the toilet was dirty but that was not the case. The apartment and toilet was a bit worn down but by no means dirty. Keep in mind that you are renting an apartment and not a luxury hotel. It is certainly good value for money and a great place to stay for a couple of days. Last but not the least, the host was very polite and friendly and i didn't get to see him much except while checking in and checking out. So, my honest assessment and recommendation is this- If you are looking for luxury and great comfort, then go to a luxury hotel. But if you want value for money, great location and a new yorker feeling stay at shunichi's, you'll not regret it!!\",\n",

It would have been nice to know this ahead of time so I had the option to consider other places.\\r\\n- As there was just one bathroom, there was a note on the door about bathroom usage and when would be blackout periods - this also would have been nice to know in advance (thumbs down).\\r\\n- I didn't really stay long enough to interact with the owner of the place but I did make an effort to at least say hello.\\r\\n- Overall the place looks a bit run down and obviously needs work.\\r\\n\",\n",

El placard es enorme y la cama comoda. \\r\\nEl WIFI no anda a la perfección pero te podes comunicar. \\r\\nLas cerraduras de la entrada del edificio son un desastre, muy difícil  abrir la puerta, mas que nada la segunda. \\r\\nRecomiendo esta habitacion dependiendo lo que busques, si es lujo aqui no lo vas a encontrar. \\r\\nPero si vas a conocer NY y no estas nunca en la habitacion, solo para dormir, mas que recomendado. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth well, almost not at home. Shunichi not feel, it's like being alone in the apartment. The best is the location and heating, cleaning worst, there is enough dust.\\r\\nBathroom a bit run down but can be used perfectly, the kitchen did not use it.\\r\\nThe area is lovely, with several places to go to eat and several subway lines. We were two and we were well, if you're one spare. The closet is huge and comfortable bed.\\r\\nThe WIFI does not go perfectly, but you can you communicate.\\r\\nThe locks on the building entrance are a mess, very difficult to open the door, but nothing the second.\\r\\nI recommend this room depending how you look, if you fancy here you will not find.\\r\\nBut if you go to NY and never know you are in the room, only to sleep, more than recommende\\r\\n\",\n",

Fue una convivencia tranquila. \\r\\nA partir del cuarto día de nuestra estadía, el wifi dejó de funcionar y estuvimos sin internet hasta el último día. \\r\\nLas fotos publicadas no coinciden con el estado real de la habitación y departamento. El departamento se encuentra muy sucio, con acumulación de cosas en los espacios comunes, está desordenado y muy deteriorado, con mobiliarios rotos en la habitación, enchufes con los cables saliendo para afuera, el piso sucio y todo rayado, las ventanas sucias, la cajonera también rota. No es un lugar habitable, no volvería bajo ninguna circunstancia. De hecho las fotos publicadas al momento de mi reserva eran otras, las de ahora se ven mucho peor y la realidad es aún peor. El baño sucio, el agua de la ducha fue imposible de graduar, o fría o hirviendo, y mala presión de agua. La cocina nada que ver con la foto, muy sucia, con cantidad de cosas acumuladas, tierra y olor. Muy desagradable en general. El departamento está abandonado, sucio, desordenado, deteriorado. A pesar de pasar todo el día afuera y de la buena ubicación, no se justifica reservar este departamento para dormir, es imposible bañarse, usar el baño cómodo y dormir tranquilo debido al desorden y la suciedad, es muy incómodo dormir ahí, con un acolchado muy sucio y que no dan ganas de usar ni de tocar.\\r\\nAclaro que yo reservé el hospedaje porque leí muchos comentarios buenos, pero leyendo los comentarios de los últimos tiempos empezaron a aparecer comentarios negativos y ahora el mio. Lamento haber reservado, esos comentarios positivos no tuvieron nada que ver con mi experiencia.\\r\\nLa ubicación fue lo UNICO bueno del hospedaje, y no justifica su reserva. Aclaro que me he hospedado en hostels y lugares muy básicos y sencillos, pero cómodos, acogedores y limpios, no se necesita mucho pero si lo básico, y acá no lo encontré.\\r\\nLamento ser dura, pero prefiero contar mi experiencia sinceramente y que otros puedan evitarse malas experiencias. \\r\\nY si me preguntan por qué me quede, es obvio, porque salir a buscar hospedaje era imposible por los costos elevados que se manejan en Manhattan.',\n",

       " \"My stay at this apartment was not the best experience, but if what you care about the most is a great location, then this is the place for you. The picture is a good reference of what to expect, although simply add an unpleasant layer of grime to everything and you have a more accurate idea. My main issue was that the room, while tidy, felt unclean and the bathroom was unpleasantly dirty, to say the least. The apartment looks really worn and it is right next to the trash room, so opening the door you smell the trash and it can be pretty disgusting. However, the inside of the apartment smelled fine. I appreciated that the room is independent of the owner's space, as a door separates the room and the bathroom from the living room and the owner's room. It was also very convenient that the room came with a fridge, microwave, toaster, and even plates and cutlery. It is pleasantly large and the bed was more of a full-sized futon. The a/c worked, but not very well, which is not an inconvenience unless one comes in the summertime like I did. Our host provided us with a room key, so it was nice to be able to lock the room and feel my stuff would not be disturbed. I didn't really see much of the owner, as a friend of his welcomed me when I arrived, and I believe that if I hadn't proceeded to ask him a few questions the one day I saw him at the apartment, we might never have talked, as he always left before I did and arrived apparently after. However, the main thing about this apartment is the location. Incredible location! It is walking distance from  Columbus Circle and all the theater area and Times Square, which made it very convenient when I got out of a play late at night. There are also a number of grocery stores nearby, including an organic whole foods style one. There are nearby subway stations and tons of restaurants, so it is easy to find anything one might need within a few blocks.\",\n",
       " 'Perfect location for the show I was seeing- thanks to the host for offering this.',\n",
       " 'The person (host\\'s friend) that was supposed to let us in the apartment at the schedule time wasn\\'t there, so we had to wait almost an hour, until the previous guest open the door for us. That person was still in the room, sheets all messy, dirty towels on the bed...nasty view. The host was already on his way to receive us due to the fact that his friend never showed up. He apologized and was quick to \"prepare the room\". Honestly, the fact that we had to wait wasn\\'t that big of a deal, hiccups happen. But the fact that after he prepare the room, it continued to look messy and dirty was kind of disappointing. To all of you looking to stay in NYC, be aware of Pros and Cons of this listing! Pros: location is excellent! Good neighborhood, very close to Central Park by Columbus Circle, lots of nice restaurants and shops nearby. This is what this listing is about. Also, he provided with maps, hairdryer, sun screen, scissors and that kind of essentials. There was a small working fridge, instant coffee, microwave and TV, which I don\\'t know if they worked, never used them.  Cons: On the other hand, the room and bathroom were really dirty, mostly the bathroom. Guys, I had to grab a cleaning brush and a bottle of cleaning product that was next to the toilet to clean the bathtub floor, because I didn\\'t dare to put my feet there, considering on how the rest of the bathroom looked. The sheets looked clean, but we didn\\'t dare to use the towels, we just used small ones that we packed just in case. The cover on the small sofa was also pretty nasty. Honestly, this is not a place to stay more than one night, and that\\'s why we decided to stay after seeing all this. If it would had been more that one night, we would have gone to our friend\\'s house in New Jersey, which it\\'d had ruined all our plans. Bottom line: If you don\\'t mind staying relatively cheap in the middle of the city, in a dirty place, this the listing to do so. At least neighborhood is safe. Otherwise, go to a different place, you got to be a care-free person to stay in a place like this, and have seen many dirty places to assimilate this. I come from a dirty 3rd world country, so there\\'s that. But never expected this in an Air bnb listing, mind you, is my first experience :( Good luck to you all! \\r\\nP.S: The $15 cleaning fee are not being used towards that, I guarantee it!',\n",

I just let him know about what time I was expected to arrive and he arranged a friend to let me in and provide me the keys. You can't beat the location. It's only a few blocks away from the Columbus Circle subway station, which is right next to Central Park. One block south is an NYPD station, so the neighborhood is fairly safe. Around the corner is Mariella's Pizza, which I highly recommend. There are several 24 hour stores in the area for your convenience. The room is very spacious and is perfect for one person, but it can accommodate two people comfortably. The mini fridge was very useful and the air conditioner worked adequately, especially during summer.  The bathroom was clean and functional and towels were provided. I stayed here for a whole week and actually saw Shunichi only one time and waved hello, so I had my privacy the entire time of my stay. I really enjoyed my stay here. In fact, if I ever do return to NYC, this is the first place I'll check to find a place to stay.\",\n",

Air conditioner works, but makes a lot of noise during the night (and you'll need it in hot summer). Bathroom is clean as far as you can see, but if you glance a little further, you'll notice some dirty spots. My towel was a bit dirty also, I had to use my bf's.

       " \"Mon amie et moi-même avons profité de l'appartement de Suchini durant 15 jours (du 26/12/16 au 08/01/17). J'ai beaucoup hésité pour la note entre 3 et 4 mais finalement j'ai tranché sur un 3 et je m'explique tout de suite. Tout d'abord parlons des points positifs : - l'appartement a une situation idéale, à 5 min de Central Park, à 10 minutes de Time Square. Le top ! On était à proximité de tout : de boutiques souvenirs, de restaurants, de fast-foods, de Columbus Circle où on peut faire ses courses facilement, bref parfait ! - la chambre est vraiment spacieuse (avec mon amie on s'est vraiment étalé, et oui on est des filles :p, mais on était vraiment à l’aise) et des équipements à dispo un frigo, un micro-onde, de la vaisselle, une TV (un peu sensible avec l'antenne), un Wi-Fi un peu capricieux parfois avec notre ordinateur, quelques nécessaires de toilette, des plans de NY à dispo... - la cuisine est à dispo et à tout ce qu'il faut pour se cuisiner des repas rapides (cela change des fast-foods à gogo :)) - la salle de bain est spacieuse également. Pas de petite salle de bain toute riquiqui, non il y a de la place dans la douche, pour se préparer, pour utiliser le lavabo… Mais malheureusement il y a quand même quelques points négatifs à retenir et pas des moindres comme : - la propreté en général. Nous ne sommes pas regardantes avec mon amie sur 2-3 poils qui pourraient se trouver dans une douche ou un grain de poussière dans l'appartement. Mais là c'était vraiment très limite, sans parler de la vétusté de l'appart, la salle de bain était vraiment borderline avec des poils, des cheveux, de la poussière par terre, le lavabo n'était pas nettoyé, je doute que le tapis soit lavé par exemple aussi. Et dans la cuisine, la plaque de gaz était grasse, noire de saleté... Dans la chambre, on aurait apprécié des draps propres entre ces deux semaines, le sol n’était pas vraiment propre, et le frigo n’était pas nettoyé. Bref nous étions vraiment déçues par rapport à cela. Et je reprécise que pourtant nous ne sommes pas difficiles en règle générale. - la salle de bain. En plus d'être très vieille (des barres de douche rouillées, des murs moisis, une vieille plomberie), prendre une douche était vraiment un calvaire. Une fois brûlante et une fois glacée, on arrivait à régler l'eau une fois sur 10. Et autant dire que c'est frustrant de pas pouvoir prendre une douche correcte quand on a marché toute la journée et qu'on est crevé. Enfin dernier point, plutôt mitigé - la communication avec l’hôte. Alors certes l’hôte est très discret et pour des gens comme moi qui préfère cela aux personnes envahissantes, c’était parfait. Néanmoins mon amie a regretté le fait de ne pas avoir parfois des infos, des recommandations (nous nous ne sommes même pas souhaités la bonne année, c’est quand même dommage quand deux...\",\n",

My flight was delayed and I arrived to check in 3 hours after I had planned to and he was still very kind!

While it may not be the cleanest pla ce in the world, it certainly didn't raise any issues with me. If you want spotless living quarters, get a fancy hotel. Shunichi provided a comfortable room with a tv, DVD player(remote needs batteries), Small fridge, microwave oven, and other appliances such as a toaster, etc. There is also a closet and a shelf-system that is perfect for your clothes. Shunichi was very prompt in replying to texts when I got to town and near his residence. He helped me carry my luggage up the 1 flight of stairs and when I made an inquiry about salt, he was at my door within 2 minutes. And that was all I saw of my host the entire week. It was like I was all alone the entire week. Since I am not a Social Butterfly around strangers, it was perfect for me. Price was VERY reasonable for staying in NYC. Thank you.\",\n",

Here is what I found recently (mid October, 2017). \\nShunichi went out of his way (via text) to accommodate my late morning arrival (before he had a chance to clean from another guest who had not even left yet). I met him at his employment where he gave me keys and directions for setting my bags down in his living room. \\nFrom Penn Station to his place, a taxi would normally cost about $10 (including tip). From Penn to his employment (opposite direction) and then to his place was about $30 total. Easy to walk the distance(s) if you do not have heavy bags to carry (I did). I would say his neighborhood is quite safe.\\nBasic needs are in the room. If you expect super basic you will not be disappointed, if you expect “style,” then this is not a place for you. I would say that is it clean “enough,” but I did not take a shower. \\nKeys: the key to locks of both building entrance doors (2) are not well aligned. I struggled for a couple of minutes, almost called him (and I can’t really say what to do to get it to work). Key to apt. itself is fine.\\nNever having stayed in downtown NYC, I was interested to learn about noise. Sunichi’s place is about 6 houses in from a main drag (8th Street) and on the second floor. I was impressed with how little I heard from the outside (with the window open a couple of inches), only an occasional siren on 8th (main drag). I slept in until 8:30...sweet!\\nWould I stay there again? I would consider it, but I’d look around for another possibility, too.',\n",
       " 'Was what I expected! Basic room but everything I needed. He provided clean towels which was great, and the door to the bedroom locked making me feel extra safe when I left my things behind to go explore.

Bathroom is the only other room you have access to, but kettle and small fridge in bedroom makes it workable.  As noted, this is basic -- think dorm-room style -- then remind yourself again about the location; neighborhood felt safe even at night.  2nd floor with lots of stairs but also high ceiling in room of this old building.

La ducha no estaba limpísima pero las he visto mucho peores, es aceptable ducharse ahí si piensas en lo barato del alojamiento y el sitio en el q está. Si vas a New York para estar todo el dia en la calle, y pasar el tiempo justo en el alojamiento para dormir descansar y ducharte es una opcion barata que te gustará. Yo repetiría! No es apto para príncipes y princesas pero estás en pleno Manhattan por muy poco dinero. Shunichi es agradable y muy escueto, tuvimos un problema con una llave y lo solucionó rapidamente.

Zudem fehlte an 2 von 7 Tagen warmes Wasser und im Bad befanden sich einige gebrauchte Überreste an Rasierern, Duschgels etc. von vorherigen Gästen - auch nicht sehr lecker. \\nDie ausgeschriebene Küche war extrem verdreckt, was aber eigentlich keine Rolle spielte, da der Raum, in dem sie sich befand, nicht zugänglich und somit für uns nicht nutzbar war. Wir wurden in jenem Raum kurz ‚geparkt‘, als eine ‚Freundin‘, von ihm, die uns auch in Empfang nahm, bei unserer Ankunft erst einmal unser Zimmer sauber machte.. das aber auch eher sporadisch. \\nDie Klimaanlage im ‚Schlafzimmer‘ funktionierte zwar, das jedoch eher halblebig; ein kühles Zimmer hatten wir jedenfalls nicht, und das sehr zu unserem Leidwesen, da es im New Yorker Hochsommer dringend nötig gewesen wäre.\\nWir mussten ihm am Anreisetag nach mehrfachem Anschreiben hinterher telefonieren, wann wir das Zimmer denn jetzt beziehen dürfen. Obwohl er jeden Abend zu Hause war kam kein einziger persönlicher Kontakt zu Stande, was wir sehr schade und auch befremdlich fanden, da wir ja Tür an Tür wohnten. Check-Out Belange klärte er dann auch lieber über die App, sprich die Gastgeberrolle wurde hier nicht wirklich wahrgenommen.\\nDer Preis war für diese tolle Lage unglaublich gut, alles andere jedoch hat einen nicht zum Verweilen verleiten können.

(2) shun was a wonderful host. he is very flexible, kind, and communicative. he adjusted check-in, check-out time for me and even took care of my luggage on the day i was supposed to check out because i had to wait until 6pm to get in to the next accommodation arrangement. (3) wireless internet works very well, and tv in the room has many channels you can enjoy while you are in your room, (4) fridge, microwave, some plates, and flatware in the room come extremely handy when you want to keep some drinks cold and have little snack without having to use the kitchen\\r\\n\\r\\n[what i did not like]\\r\\n(1) it was very tricky to use shower temperature control. the water becomes easily too cold or hot. (2) lighting in the room was bit dark to me (3) no mirror in the room (4) heating system was broken at the time i stayed, so i had to use shun's small portable heater that was not strong enough\",\n",
